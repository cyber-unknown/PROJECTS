FILE CONVERSION I/O

<-> INTRODUCTION :
					This is a file conversion tool made using python. In this project we have combined multiple file conversion programs into one application
					mainly based on school level project

<-> USAGE : 
					Run REQUIREMENT.py --> installs all the required modules
					Run FILECONVERSIONIO.py
					
			caution:
			      make sure asserts folder is in the same location of the conversion tool
			      output is saved in the same directory of the input file with the same name
			
<-> AVAILABLE CONVERSIONS :
			
				 ~# PDF -> IMAGE
				 ~# PDF -> WORD
				 ~# WORD -> IMAGE
				 ~# WORD -> PDF
				 ~# IMAGE -> WORD

<-> FLAWS :
				THE TOOLS FAILS TO CONVERT TEXT IN WORD DOCUMENT TO IMAGE.
				IN IMAGE TO PDF AND WORD CONVERSION THE CONVERSION SUPPORTS ONLY JPEG,JPG,PNG.
				THE NUMBER OF CONVERSIONS ARE LIMITED AND CANT BE UPDATED
				THE OUTPUT OF PDF TO IMAGE WILL BE SAVED ONLY IN DESKTOP
	
<-> THINGS THAT CAN BE ADDED :
				warning box can be added for wrong conversions.
