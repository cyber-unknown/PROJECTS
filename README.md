# FILE CONVERSION I/O

## Introduction
This Python-based file conversion tool is a versatile utility that combines multiple file conversion programs into a single application. Initially designed for school-level projects, it offers a user-friendly experience with a modern graphical user interface and animations.

## Usage
To get started, follow these steps:

1. Run `REQUIREMENT.py` to install all the necessary modules.
2. Execute `FILECONVERSIONIO.py`.

   **Caution**:
   - Ensure that the `asserts` folder is in the same directory as the conversion tool.
   - The output will be saved in the same directory as the input file with the same name.

## Available Conversions
You can perform the following conversions:

- PDF ➡️ IMAGE
- PDF ➡️ WORD
- WORD ➡️ IMAGE
- WORD ➡️ PDF
- IMAGE ➡️ WORD
- IMAGE ➡️ PDF

## Supported Operating System
This tool is primarily designed for Windows, but it can be configured for other operating systems with some programming knowledge.

## Known Flaws
While this tool is highly versatile, it has a few limitations:

- It may fail to convert text in Word documents to images.
- Image to PDF and Word conversions support only JPEG, JPG, and PNG formats.
- The number of supported conversions is fixed and cannot be easily expanded.
- The output of PDF to image conversions will be saved only on the desktop.

## Potential Improvements
Here are some enhancements that could be considered:

- Adding a warning prompt for incorrect conversions to improve user experience.
- Addressing flaws through the integration of more appropriate modules.
- Displaying the output path after each conversion for user convenience.

**PS: Feel free to use this tool in school projects; it offers a unique idea with an amazing GUI and modern user experience enhanced with animations!**
